# A Generalized Approach to Redundant Calibration with JAX

The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) relies on redundant calibration with [redcal](https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_cal/blob/master/hera_cal/redcal.py) from the [hera_cal](https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_cal) package to calibrate its data, which assumes Gaussian noise statistics, linearizes the measurement equation and minimizes the Ï‡2. We show generalization of this maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to non-Gaussian statistics and without the need for linearization, which can be achieved at good computational performance with very little programming effort by repurposing open-source libraries intended for machine learning, in this case [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax). As an example, we show a comparison between Gaussian and Cauchy assumed noise distributions in the calibration of a sample HERA dataset, with the latter showing expected resilience to radio-frequency interference (RFI).
